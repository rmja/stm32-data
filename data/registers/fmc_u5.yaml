      description: "This register contain the current error\r correction code value computed by the ECC computation\r modules of the FMC NAND controller. When the CPU\r reads/writes the data from a NAND Flash memory page at\r the correct address (refer to Section20.8.6: Computation\r of the error correction code (ECC) in NAND Flash memory),\r the data read/written from/to the NAND Flash memory are\r processed automatically by the ECC computation module.\r When X bytes have been read (according to the ECCPS field\r in the FMC_PCR registers), the CPU must read the computed\r ECC value from the FMC_ECC registers. It then verifies if\r these computed parity data are the same as the parity\r value recorded in the spare area, to determine whether a\r page is valid, and, to correct it otherwise. The FMC_ECCR\r register should be cleared after being read by setting\r the ECCEN bit to 0. To compute a new data block, the\r ECCEN bit must be set to 1."

fieldset/ECCR:
  description: "This register contain the current error\r correction code value computed by the ECC computation\r modules of the FMC NAND controller. When the CPU\r reads/writes the data from a NAND Flash memory page at\r the correct address (refer to Section20.8.6: Computation\r of the error correction code (ECC) in NAND Flash memory),\r the data read/written from/to the NAND Flash memory are\r processed automatically by the ECC computation module.\r When X bytes have been read (according to the ECCPS field\r in the FMC_PCR registers), the CPU must read the computed\r ECC value from the FMC_ECC registers. It then verifies if\r these computed parity data are the same as the parity\r value recorded in the spare area, to determine whether a\r page is valid, and, to correct it otherwise. The FMC_ECCR\r register should be cleared after being read by setting\r the ECCEN bit to 0. To compute a new data block, the\r ECCEN bit must be set to 1."
